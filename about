                    <p>Hello! My name is Pen Fang, and I am a student at Cornell University studying art history and information science. I love art and media and creation, and I am trying to put more creation into my daily life. Some current areas of interest in my studies are: gender and sexuality studies, Greek tragedy, contemporary art, surrealism, film history, networks and algorithms.</p>

                        <p>the keurig hums to life</p>
                        <p>drip drop, the sound of your heart</p>
                        <p>splattering against the floor</p>
                        <p>crimson, purple caressing your knees</p>
                        <p>now you’re alone running circles around</p>
                        <p> the hole in the earth</p>
                        <p>like clockwork, like crochet, stitch after stitch</p>
                        <p> your footsteps pitter-patter in loops</p>
                        <p> drip drop</p>

                        <p>flower field parting in cyclical motion</p>
                        <p>orbit of absence</p>
                        <p>there’s a hole in the earth</p>
                        <p>that you can’t avoid, won’t avoid, circle like water</p>
                        <p>down the drain</p>
                        <p>these bruises will fade</p>
                        <p>and when the pain stops cutting knife-hot</p>
                        <p>splintering your chest</p>
                        <p>then what will you have left?</p>

                        <p>ashes to ashes and dust to dust</p>
                        <p>you’re running in circles around a hole in the earth</p>

                        <p>i think i’ve forgotten how to be</p>
                        <p>without you by my side</p>
                        <p>so your chest kisses the dirt like a lover</p>
                        <p>lying spread eagle next to the hole in the earth</p>
                        <p>home in the earth</p>

                        <p>everything goes</p>
                        <p>your sun the moon sealed in a silent tomb</p>
                        <p>silent prayer called grief</p>
                        <p>the artist’s grave of permanence</p>
                        <p>i’ll never get you back i’ll never see you again</p>
                        <p>you don’t know what to do anymore</p>
                        <p>so you’re tracing circles around a hole in the earth</p>
                        <p>with your footprints over and over and over</p>
                        <p>your knees against the grass</p>
                        <p>purple. green. white knuckled fists</p>
                        <p>begging, begging

                <p>I am currently a college student and work on graphics for various clubs, including Cornell E.Motion and Cornell YDSA. I am working on making postcards and cards to send back to my hometown. My short-term goals including making more political art, and as always, trying to figure out what art means to me. My long-term plan is to paint another mural over the summer if I have the means, and synthesize my studies with creating art.</p>

                <p>Here is a sketch/study I have done recently. I really wanted to capture the emotions. I wanted my art to be something more than just a pretty picture or a copy. Of course, I'm not sure where I am in terms of that, but I am going to keep experimenting until I find out. I'm trying to be more hybrid and physical with my creation, tying art with writing and more. My most recent sketchbook escapades include using dirt and water to paint a piece and a study in crayon.</p>

                    <p>one morning this sadness will fossilize</p>

                    <p>i think it’s a spark because it eats you up</p>
                    <p>from the inside until there’s nothing left</p>
